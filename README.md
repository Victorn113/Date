This java project lets the user enter day, month, and year numerically. The program displays the date in three different ways. The files named BadAlloc, BadAlloc, and NegativeYear are used in a try-catch sequence in the file 'Date' to make sure the day does not exceed the total number of days in any month and the month does not exceed 12. These files are also meant to catch cases with negative numbers entred. The file NegativeYear is used as a catch method for printing 'BC for negative years entered.
